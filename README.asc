= Geochemical Scripts

This is a repository containing python scripts for performing geochemical calculations. 
These scripts focus on calculating weathering rates from soil and regolith profiles

The current contents include

. A series of scripts to replicate the plots of http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6178/1502[Maher and Chamberlain, 2014]. 
These include:
.. `Maher_flux_erosion_rate.py`: These reproduce plots from http://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2014/03/12/science.1250770.DC1[Maher and Chamberlain's 2014 supplemental materials], figure S5.
.. `Maher_Variables.py`: This is an object used to calculate the variables for use in other scripts for reproducing the Maher and Chamberlain results. 
. A script to replicate the results from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254113005664[Li et al., 2014]. These include:
.. `Li_numerical_solution_2014.py`: Outputs dimensionless concentration of mineral j and solute i as a function of depth, time, and residence times using a finite difference model.
. Severl scripts to replicate the results of http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1954/abstract[Lebedeva et al., 2010]. These include:
.. `weath_zone_thickness_erosion.py`: A script for computing the weathering zone thickness as a function of erosion, to reproduce Figure 2 of http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1954/abstract[Lebedeva et al., 2010].
.. `Dissolved_Na_Si_flux_with_darcy_velocity.py`: This computes Na and Si flux as function of darcy velocity using the http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1954/abstract[Lebedeva et al. (2010) model]. 
.. `Dissolved_Na_Si_flux_with_erosion.py`: This computes Na and Si flux as function of erosion rate using the http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1954/abstract[Lebedeva et al. (2010) model]. 
.. `Chemical_depletion_factor_with _erosion_na_si.py`: : This computes Na and Si-based chemical depletion factor (CDF) as function of erosion rate using the http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1954/abstract[Lebedeva et al. (2010) model].
